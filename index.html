                        <p class="daas-intro">
                            When the cold season hits, hair tangles become tougher, drier, and harder to manage. Low humidity and constant friction from scarves or sweaters often lead to unwanted knots that break and frizz. But before you reach for another chemical-laden detangler, let's talk about eco-friendly solutions that are kinder to your hair and the planet.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="daas-heading">1. Switch to a Sustainable Brush</h3>
                        <p class="daas-text">
                            An eco detangling brush made from bamboo or recycled materials glides through hair while reducing static and waste. It's perfect for sensitive scalps and offers a smoother, more natural detangling experience.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="daas-heading">2. Moisture Matters</h3>
                        <p class="daas-text">
                            During colder months, your hair needs extra hydration. Incorporate plastic-free haircare products like solid conditioners rich in coconut oil, shea butter, and aloe vera — all proven to reduce tangles naturally.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="daas-heading">3. Detangle Gently, Not Forcefully</h3>
                        <p class="daas-text">
                            Always start from the ends and work upward in sections. Gentle detangling tips can make the difference between smooth strands and unnecessary breakage.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="daas-heading">4. Sleep Smart</h3>
                        <p class="daas-text">
                            Switch to silk or satin pillowcases to reduce friction overnight — one of the simplest ways to say goodbye to morning tangles.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class="daas-text">
                            By choosing sustainable haircare practices, you're not only keeping your locks tangle-free but also contributing to a cleaner, greener planet. This season, let your beauty routine reflect the best of both worlds — eco-conscious and effortlessly smooth.
